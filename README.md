# JUST-OS for All
Despite (or due to) the overwhelming amount of information on Open Science, it is practised way less than it is preached. To bridge this gap, we propose JUST-OS, a chatbot to navigate Open Science resources. Technically, JUST-OS uses retrieval-augmented generation, an AI-based natural language processing method, which operates on an Open Science database on FORRT. Practically, JUST-OS assists in navigating initiatives, knowledge, and resources for various stakeholders by answering their questions interactively and leading them to related practices or topics. Thus, JUST-OS will contribute to making Open Science more accessible, aligning researchers' behaviour with their generally positive Open Science attitudes.
