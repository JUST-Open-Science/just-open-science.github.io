# JUST-OS for all: An AI-based chatbot for navigating Open Science resources
Despite (or due to) the overwhelming amount of information on Open Science, it is practised way less than it is preached. To bridge this gap, we propose JUST-OS, a chatbot to navigate Open Science resources. Technically, JUST-OS uses retrieval-augmented generation, an AI-based natural language processing method, which operates on an Open Science database on FORRT. Practically, JUST-OS assists in navigating initiatives, knowledge, and resources for various stakeholders by answering their questions interactively and leading them to related practices or topics. Thus, JUST-OS will contribute to making Open Science more accessible, aligning researchers' behaviour with their generally positive Open Science attitudes.
